# libsai tests directory
These tests are written in c++ and are intended to test and demonstrate writing DASH API configuration and management code which links to the `libsai` library for DASH. In particular, these programs use the SAI-to-P4Runtime adaptor layer. As such they require many libraries including gRPC, protobuf, P4 PI layer etc. in addition to `libsai` itself.
