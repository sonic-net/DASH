# Github basic process

**Table of contents**
 - [Github basic process](#github-basic-process)

This document describes a short process to effectively use GitHub to achieve the following main goals:

1. Proposing a change. 
2. Reporting a bug. 
3. Making impovement suggestions.   


## Use Github issues

We encourge the interested parties to use the **Issues** mechanism to report problems, bugs and suggest potential improvements. This helps with our communication. Please, include relevant details the rest of the team needs to understand in order to discuss the issue effectively. 

A small example of this: including the version of the software being described in a bug report.


## Use pull requests (PRs)
