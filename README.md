# Project - Disaggregated API for SONiC Hosts (SONiC DASH)

> SONiC DASH is a new open source project that "will deliver enterprise network performance to critical cloud applications.  The project extends functionality to stateful workloads.  

Comprised of a developing set of APIs and object models describing network services for the cloud, we will work with all cloud providers and enterprise hybrid clouds to develop further functionality. We believe the DASH program describes a comprehensive set of services that are required by the vast majority of clouds. The goal of DASH is to be specific enough for SMART Programmable Technologies to optimize network performance and leverage commodity hardware technology to achieve 10x or even 100x stateful connection performance.

The technology has multiple applications such as 1) NIC on a host, 2) a SmartToR, 3) Network Disaggregation, and 4) high performance Network Appliances. Many technology companies have committed to further developing this new open technology and its community. The best minds and practitioners are actively coming together to optimize performance of the cloud by extending SONiC to include stateful workloads. 
 
Future innovations for in-service software upgrades and ultra-high availability for stateful connections will also be developed with the utmost importance. 

We hope that DASH will have the same success as SONiC for switches and also be widely adopted as a major Open NOS for Programmable Technologies (including SmartNICs) to supercharge a variety of cloud and enterprise applications. 

## Where to Start?

Please begin with 1) the SDN Packet Transforms document, this facilitates understanding of the program goal and the 7 networking scenarios that Azure has defined.  Next 2) Load Balancer_v3, 3) Service Tunneling and Private Link Features, 4) Program Scale Testing Requirements - Draft, and 6) API.

The API and Object Model for VNET<->VNET is in draft; the remaining services will be posted over Oct/Nov time frame here.
